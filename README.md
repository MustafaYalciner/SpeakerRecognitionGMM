# SpeakerRecognitionGMM

A speaker verification system based on Gaussian Mixture Models is implemented as part of a project at my university. 
A GMM model was build for each subject independently with a best overall performance in terms of equal error rate under some restrictions. Serveral performance measures were also calculated.
In addition to the foreground models for each subject, a universal background model was implemented and, again, the performance results are calculated to show the performance improvement compared to the implementation without the universal background model.
Feel free to message me for further details.
